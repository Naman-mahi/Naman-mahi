## 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious mind with a keyboard and a mission:  
**To create technology that’s smart, secure, and stylish.**  
Here's a bit about what drives me:

- 🧠 **AI/ML Explorer**  
  Crafting intelligent systems using Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch & Scikit-learn.  
  Passionate about machine learning models that solve real-world problems — from automation to analytics.

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Advocate & Ethical Hacker**  
  Currently pursuing a **Master's in Cybersecurity**, I ethically break systems to expose vulnerabilities before the bad guys do. Tools I love: Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Kali Linux. I thrive in CTFs, pen-testing, and red teaming.

- 💻 **Full Stack Developer**  
  From responsive frontends to robust backends — I build with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MySQL. Security-first coding is my philosophy. I build apps that are functional and resilient.

- 🌌 **Vibe Coder + UI Minimalist**  
  Obsessed with clean interfaces, dark mode everything, subtle animations, and frictionless user flows. Code is not just logic — it's art, too.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Tech Lead & Collaborator**  
  Leading teams, mentoring juniors, and building products that matter. I believe in growing through sharing.

- 🌍 Based in **Gondia, India**  
- 🎂 Age: **24**  
- ☕ Energy source: Coffee + Curiosity + Late-night debugging  
- ⚔️ Mission: Merging **AI + Cybersecurity** to secure tomorrow's tech
